    "## Part 1:  Variants of the perceptron algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will work with several variants of the perceptron algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The \"vanila\" version of the perceptron algorithm, which was introduced in class.\n",
    "  * The pocket algorithm as described in the slides or page 80 in the book.\n",
    "  * The **adatron** version of the perceptron described next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case make sure that your implementation of the classifier **includes a bias term** (in slide set 2 and page 7 in the book you will find guidance on how to add a bias term to an algorithm that is expressed without one).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The adatron \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to the adatron, we will derive an alternative form of the perceptron algorithm --- the dual perceptron algorithm.  All we need to look at is the weight update rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{w} + \\eta y_i \\mathbf{x}_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is performed whenever example $i$ is misclassified by the current weight vector.  The thing to notice, is that the weight vector is always a weighted combination of the training examples since it is that way to begin with, and each update maintains that property.  So in fact, rather than representing $\\mathbf{w}$ explicitly, all we need to do is to keep track of how much each training example is contributing to the value of the weight vector, i.e. we will express it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\alpha_i y_i \\mathbf{x}_i,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_i$ are positive numbers that describe the magnitude of the contribution $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is making to the weight vector, and $N$ is the number of training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore to initialize $\\mathbf{w}$ to 0, we simply initialize $\\alpha_i = 0$ for $i = 1,\\ldots,N$.  When expressed using the variables $\\alpha_i$, the perceptron update rule becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_i = \\alpha_i + \\eta y_i,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and you can always retrieve the weight vector using its expansion in terms of the $\\alpha_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready for the adatron - the only difference is in the initialization and update equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha_i = 1$ for $i = 1,\\ldots,N$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the perceptron we run the algorithm until convergence, or until a fixed number of epochs has passed (an epoch is a loop over all the training data), and an epoch of training consists of the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "for each training example $i=1,\\ldots,N$ perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  $\\gamma = y_i * \\mathbf{w}^{t} \\mathbf{x}_i$\n",
    "2.  $\\delta\\alpha = \\eta * (1 - \\gamma)$\n",
    "3.  `if` $(\\alpha_i + \\delta\\alpha < 0)$ : $\\alpha_i = 0$, `else : ` $\\alpha_i = \\alpha_i + \\delta\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable $\\eta$ plays the role of the learning rate $\\eta$ employed in the perceptron algorithm and $\\delta \\alpha$ is the proposed magnitude of change in $\\alpha_i$. \n",
    "We note that the adatron tries to maintain a **sparse** representation in terms of the training examples by keeping many $\\alpha_i$ equal to zero.  The adatron converges to a special case of the SVM algorithm that we will learn later in the semester; this algorithm tries to maximize the margin with which each example is classified, which is captured by the variable $\\gamma$ in the algorithm (notice that the magnitude of change proposed for each $\\alpha_i$ becomes smaller as $\\gamma$ increases towards 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** if you observe an overflow issues in running the adatron, add an upper bound on the value of $\\alpha_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Implement the pocket algorithm and the adatron; each classifier should be implemented in a separate Python class, and use the same interface used in the code provided for the perceptron algorithm, i.e. provides the same methods with the same signature.  Make sure each classifier you use (including the original version of the perceptron) implements a bias term.\n",
    "  - Compare the performance of these variants of the perceptron on the Gisette and QSAR datasets by computing an estimate of the out of sample error on a sample of the data that you reserve for testing (the test set).  In each case reserve about 60% of the data for training, and 40% for testing.  To gain more confidence in our error estimates, repeat this experiment using 10 random splits of the data into training/test sets.  Report the average error and its standard deviation in a nicely formatted table.  Is there a version of the perceptron that appears to perform better?   (In answering this, consider the differences in performance you observe in comparison to the standard deviation).\n",

    "\n",
    "Whenever we train a classifier it is useful to know if we have collected a sufficient amount of data for accurate classification.  A good way of determining that is to construct a **learning curve**, which is a plot of classifier performance (i.e. its error) as a function of the number of training examples.  Plot a learning curve for the perceptron algorithm (with bias) using the Gisette dataset.  The x-axis for the plot (number of training examples) should be on a logarithmic scale - something like 10,20,40,80,200,400,800.  Use numbers that are appropriate for the dataset at hand, choosing values that illustrate the variation that you observe.  What can you conclude from the learning curve you have constructed?  Make sure that you use a fixed test set to evaluate performance while varying the size of the training set."

    "  * Correctness of answers to math problems\n",
